First of all we we shoud define the reasons "why we shoud create Session state table named ASP.NET SESSION STATE"
    Answer: By default session is stored in memory and when you come across situation scaling your microservices you have to store session in other presistent storage,
            for instance in file or database shared between all instances.
 Steps to set up:
    Create table `ASP.NET_SessionState`.
    Add field `SessionId`, make it's as Primary Key with `String` data type.
    Add specific AWSSDK.dll & AWS.SessionProvider.dll to the project.
    Put configuration in web.config file.

Windows 11 features supplied with new version in this year.

Windows 11 brings a brand-new, more Mac-like interface to OS. It features a clean design with rounded
corneds pastel shades. The icon Start menu also moves to the center of the screen along with the Taskbar.
But you can move those back to the left as they are in the Windows 10.

Android apps are now avaliable for Windows 11 through the Microsoft Store via the Amazone Appstore.
There were a couple of ways to access Android apps on Windows 10 including if you  had a Samsung Galaxy phone,
but this will make it native.
This is someting windows's users has been wating for for the years and makes another move towards the merging of mobile and laptop devices.
Read more: Windows 11 Finally Adds Android Apps. Here's How to Downlaod Them.

**BETTER Virual Desktop Support**

Windows 11 will let you set up virtual desktops in a way that's similar to Macs. It allows
for toggling between multiple desktop at once for personal work school or gaming.
In Windows 10, this was handler to set up and use.
The new OS includes features called Snap Groups and Snap Layouts - collections of the apps you are using at once that sit in the taskbar,
and can come up or be minimized 
**Teams** is getting facelips and will be integrated directly in the windows 11 taskbar.

Create a repository

You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repostoires. including open source project. With open source projects, you can share code to make better,
more reliable software. You can use repositories to collaborate with others and trak your work. For more information, see "About repositories".

In the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New repostory

Type a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "Hello world"
Oplionally add a description of your repository. For example, My first repository on Github
Description (optional)
Public Internal Private
Select Initialize this repository with a README file.
Click create repository.
Commit your first change.
A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.
When you created your new repository. you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more, or add some documents such as
how to install or use your project.
The contents of your README file are  automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
Let's commit a change to the README file.

Basic Git Comamnds:
    
    JFYI: To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application
    like Github Descktop. Here are some common commands for using Git:
    git init  intialize a brand new Git repository and begins traking an existing directly. It adds a hidden subfolder whithin the existing directly that houses the internal data structure required
    for version control.

    __git clone__ creates a local copy of a project that already exits remotely.
    The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.

    __git add__  stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take ansapshot
    of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that of that two-step process.
    Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and commiting separately
    gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.

    __git commit__  saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-traking process. In short, commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add
    will become a part of the snapshot with git commit .
    Revieve activity
    When you take actions across Github we will provide links to that activity here.


**await-to-js**

Pre-requisites
You need to use Node 7.6 or later or an ES7 transpaler in order to use async/await functionality. you can use bable or typescript for that.

npm install await-to-js --save
Usage
import to from 'await-to-js'
// If you use common JS (either NODE js environment) it should be:
// const to = required('await-to-js').default;

async function asyncTakeWithCb() {....}

**MSDM Docs**

The following tutorials show how to develope console apps and libraries for .NET apps, .NET 5 / Core, an later versions. For other types of applications see Tutorials for getting started with .NET.
Use Visual Studio:
Create a console app
Debug an app
Publish an app
Create a class library
Unit Test a class library
Install and use a package
Create a F# project

Install and use a package:
Quickstart: Install and use packages in Visual Studio for Mac
NuGet packages contain reusable code that other devs make available for use in your projects. See what is NuGet? for backgoround.
Packages are installed into a Visual Studio for Mac project using the NuGet Package Manager.
This article demonstrate the process using the popular package Newtonsoft.Json and .NET Core Console project.
The same process applies to any other Xamarin or .NET Core project.

Once installed, refer to the package in code with using <namespace> where <namespace> is specific to the package you are using.
Once the reference is made, you can call the pacakge through its API.
Start with nuget.org Browsing nuget.org is how .NET Devs typically find componnets they can reuse in their own applications.
You can search nuget.org directly or find and install package within Visual Studio as shown in this acticle. For general information,
see Find and ecaluate NuGet packages.

You can install the 2019 Community edition for free from visualstudion.com or use the Proffersional or Enterprise Editions.
If you are using Visual Studion for Windows, see Install and use a package in Visual Studio (Windows Only).

Create a project

Nuget packages can be installed into any .NET projet, provided that the package supports the same target framework as the project.
For this wallthrough, use a simple .NET Core Console app. Create a project in Visual Studio for Mac using File -> New -> Solution..., select the .NET Core -> App -> Console Application template.
click Next, Accept the defaunt values for Target Framework when prompted.
Visual Studio creates the projet, which opens in Solution Exproler.

Add the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package
To install this package, you use the NuGet Package Manager. When you install a pacakge, NuGet records the dependency in either your project file or a packages.config file
for more information, see Package consuption overview and workflow.

__Serilog.Extensions.Loggin.File package__

Text to Json file output
Files roll over on date; capped file size
Request ids and event ids included with the message
Writes are performed on a backgound thread.
Files are periodically flushed to disk (required fir Azure App Serivce log collection)
Fast, stable, battle-proven loggin code courtesy of Serilog

You can get started quickly with this package, and later migrate to the full Serilog API if you need more sophisticated log file configuration.

Getting started
1. Add the NuGet package as a dependency of your project either with the package manager of directly to the *.csproj file.
2. In your Program class file, configure logging on the web host builder, and call AddFile() on the provided loggingBuilder
WebHost.CreatDefaultBuilder()
       .ConfigureLogging(){....}
Done! The framework will inject ILogger.

Signin for GitHub account
Git offers personal accounts for individuals and organuzations
for teams of people working together.

Abount new accounts in Github.com
You can create a personal account, which services as your identity on GitHUb.com, or an organization,
which allows multiple personal accounts to collaborate across multiple projects. For more information about account types, see "GitHub's projects".

Signig up for a new account
if you want to create a new personal account, make sure you are currently signed out of GitHub.
Go to GitHub's Pricing page.
Read the information about the different products and subscriptions that GitHub offers, then click the upgrade button under the subscription
you would like to choose.
Follow the prompts to create your personal account or organization.
Next steps
"Verify your email address"
"Creating an enterprise account" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation
GitHub public roadmap in the github/roadman repository

Verifying your email address
Verifying your primary email address ensure strenghened security,
allows GitHub staff to better assist you if you forget your password,
and gives you access to more features on GitHub.

About Email verification
You can verify your email address after signing up for a mew account, or when you add a new email
address. If an email address, you will not be able to:
 * Create or fork repositories
 * Create issues of pull requests
 * Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
 * Authorize OAuth App apllications
 * Generate personal access tokens
 * Receive email notifications
 * Star repositories
 * Create and update project boards, including adding cards
 * Create or update gists
 * Create or use GitHub Actions
 * Sponsor developers with GitHub Sponsors

Warnings:
 - You can not verify email addresses from disposable email address services (services that allow to receive email at a temporary address that expires after a certain time)
   If you would like to keep your email address private, you can use a GitHub-provided noreply email address. For more information, see "Settings your commit email address on GitHub"
 
 - If an organization you are a member of restricts email notifications to an approved email domain, you will need to verify an email address in that domain to reveive email
   notifications about activity in the organization. For more inforamtion, see "Restricting email notifications to an approved domain".

Deleting remote branch of tag
The syntax to delete a branch is a bit arcane at fist glance;
git pust <REMOTENAME> : <BRANCHNAME>
Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles (напоминать) the same steps you would take to rename a branch.
However, here, you are telling Git to push nothing into BRANCHNAME TO REMOTENAME.
Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.
Remotes and forks
You might already known that you can "fork" repositories on GitHub.
That I have never really been able to truly control.

git fetch upstream 
# Grab the upstream remote's branches.

**5/18/2022**
Searching for the repositories
You can search for repos on GitHub and narrow the results using these repository search qualifiers in any combination.
You can search for repos globally across all of GitHub.com, of search for repos within a particular organization, see "Searching in forks"
Tips:
    For a list of search syntaxes that can add to any search qualifier to futher improve your results, see "Understanding the search syntax".
    Use quotations around-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues  with the label "In progress" you would search for label:"in progress". Search is not sensitive.

Main functionality in Angular 14 (3 Big Things are coming in Angular 14)

1. Better typing @angular/forms. These changes will affect on reactive forms types model and will make type checking much more striker than before.
The team is aiming at implementing the type system that will be complatible with other angular versions, and will not cause regression. Such a feature will allow
developers to find the issues during development tume and significantly improve type checking.

2. Independent Components from Module. Let's try to answer the question, which is the only fronend framework that components are not "units of reuse"?
And of course you known the answer - only Angular framework is all built around the modules.
In Anuglar, Modules actually act as "units of reuse", for example, angualar libraries

3. Will micro frondend be supported ? - Yes, partially
    There is very little information if the Micro frontend will be supported on Angular 14, or other releases.

__English with Lucy__
Big big lesson in YouTube channel English with Lucy.
Let's start today's class with a question
How many words do you think there are in the English language ?

BBC Article.
Learning a new language can be tricky, but how many words do you need to know before you actually get by in English tongue ?
That was a question posted in BBC Radio's 4 More or Less programme by one fristrated license. Despite learning Gernman for three years, 
and practicing nearly every day
I will tell you the answer, well
that there are over 170.000 words in English language. That's a lot of words, but on average a native English speakers will know between 15 and 20.000
This is an insane amount of words.
I can not even count to 20.000 but don't despair 
Peaky - Острый Blinders - seasons - 1, episond - 1
miss out - пропустить 
do not miss out - не пропустить
first we have  - man
urged - призвал что то сдетать
obscure - затемнять
immense - огромный
i urged to march - я призвал маршировать
I have appealed to everyone in the world.
Right, I have called this family meeting. Scud boat and Love got back from Belfast last night

What is wget tool - GNU Tool in Linux (Ubuntu system)
GNU wget tool commonly called just wget is free command-line utility for transferring files using HTTP/HTTPS, FTP and FTPS protocols.
It provides features like recursive downlaods, bandwidth control, resumes aborted transfersm, background downlaods, recursive mirror files and directories, and many more.
How to install cURL, wget tools ?
cURL and wget are popular tools readily available in major Linux distributions; if you do not have either tool installed, you use the commands below
to install:
sudo apt-get install curl
sudi apt-get install wget
curl is support a lot of different protocols DICT FILE FTP GOPHER IMAP and so on.
we can treat curl as a general-purpose tool for transferring data from one server to other.
On the other hand, wget is basically network downlaoder.
Recursive Downlaod
When we wish to make a local copy of a wesite, wget is tool to use it. curl does not provide recursive downlaod.
We often need to downlaod files from remote servers to our local machine. On a graphical desktop we can use a GUI browser and click
the download button. However, on a terminal. When downloading files from the terminal, four tools come up: curl, wget, axel, aria2.
While axel and aria2 man not be well known, most terminal users know, curl, wget.
This tutorial is focused on the similaries and the differences between cURL.
Althogh it may seem like cURL is the superior choice, there are instances where wget is the best choice.
My advice to you is to choose what works for you.

        // TODO: set large fields to null.

        _disposed = true;
    }
}

We can see that files are unmanaged resourced due to creation by operation system and we are disposiong its in the end ope method.
_safeHandler is managed resources and created by RunTime therefore this resource disposed inside if (disposing) block.

Managed code is code whose execution is managed by RunTime and CLR.
Unmanaged code - exaples: 
- Some functions from C++ libs (Unmanaged memory)
- Files (File descriptors of Operaiton system)
- Network connections
- Sockets

Intermadiate Language & execution

What is "Intenmadiate Language and execution" or short IL ?
It is product of compilation of code written in high-level .NET languages.
Once you comlile your code written in of of these languages, you will get a binary that is made out of IL.
IT is important to note that the IL is independent from any specific language that runs on top of the runtime; there is even a separate
specification for it that you can read if you are so __inclined__-(наклонный, склонный, расположенный)
Once you produce your IL code from high-level code, you will most likely want to ...


**.NET Garbage Collector**
.NET's garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for you application. Each time you create a new
object, the command language runtime allocates memory for the object from the managed heap. As long as addess space is available in the
managed heap, the runtime continues to allocate space for the new objects. However, memory is not __infinity__.

I hope you can take things from this course and practice it again and again, and then you are going to be fluent English speacker.
That is a idea so i just hope you keep in your mind that practice of things, not just learning.
Learning is the first step, but you should also practice a lot of other things to be fluent in English.

English with Lucy another session.
Adgenda is adjectives. Adjectives are used to describe the nouns in English sentences.
They can describe size, colour, amount, feeling, et cetera.
take a look at this basic sentence `i have a car`
There is no any adjectives but we is able to add them to paint better picture for the reader or the listener.
I have a `red` car. `red` is adjective or may be we is going to use multiple adjecties
I have a `large, red, Italian,` car, whole words in the `` are adjectives.
Perhaps some of you knew that infomation but its never hurts (повредить) to review.
Lets talk about `ED adjectives`, there are adjectives with ED in the end.
tired, intrested, exited.
These adjectives are used to describe personal feels.
I'm bored -> I feel bored
We are amazed  we felt amazed
He was impressed with the plants for the new building.
They are intrested in my new book.
`ing adjectives` used to describe how something makes someone feels.
The meal was readly satisfying
It made me feel satisfied.

come across = encountered.
`Walking` always puts me in a good mood.
`Walking` is gerund in that sentence 
gerund is verb with ing endian that behaves like noun. ходьба
infinitive is the simplest form of the verb to + base verb
Next i'm goining to write some sentences from Netflix series named `Brooklyn nine-nine`
And i'm stiil not rigth

These is one ritual that happens in every corner of the world.
Over miliniam, humans have turned the eating into culture.
A way to celebrate a roots. To bring us together.
it's where you get power to live your life.
Even when you are sitting completely stiil (неподвижно), your body needs a lot of energy to stay on.
But notwhere is the need for fuel more apparent than when you push yourselt to the absolute limit.
It's the teacher that shows us how to overcome obstacles in the life. And finally its form of medicine. It's helps heal us.
When we feel the connection to the earth and to the sky and to the creator, we yell (мы кричим)

And they send the body to the edge of collapse.
See, the human body is an amazing machine, capable of feats (подвиги) that seem impossible to most of us.
But like all machines it requires fuel.
Every one of our nearly 40 trilion cells needs the juice to power on. And its looked inside every plant and seed on Earth.
The trick is extracting it.
Petroleum is also known as crude oil, is naturally occuring, yellowish-black liquid found in geological formations. It is commonly refined into variuos fuelds and chemicals.
Components of petroleum are separated by means of distilation. Petroleum is mainly consist of hydrocarbons as well as traces of other organic componnets.

I want to start of witch coincided with the most deadly period in human history.

The second world war tow ended in May 1945 but it was several months later before the most horrific conflict in human history
In August the US military dropped the nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

The Soviets tested their fist atomic bombs on the steppes in what is now Kazakhstan
triggered the onset of the tense 40-years nuclear standoff between Russian and USA - the Cold War

At some point perhaps when this problem with the Soviet Union was resolved and we got on the same page and was like okey great
you are communists, we are capitalists, but that's fine. You helped the world win in war. Let's work together. That did not happen.

Then nucleur submarines putting on tracks, putting them on launchpads
These series of nuclear tests were preceded by astonishing events.
Events that raised a completely different kind of concern. And helped perticipate the creation of many top secrets projects.
Okey go and switch to other top - Multitasking in C#, article taken from MSDN site.

A multitasking operation system divides the available processor time among the processes or threads that need it.
The system is designed for preemptive multitaskinng; It allocates a processor time slice to each thread it executes.
When the system switches from one thread to another, it saves the context of preempted thread and restores the saved context of the next thread in the queue.

__Advantages of Multitasking__
The the user, the advantage of multitasking is the ability to several applications open and working at the same time.

Today I want to write about python language using official docs & voice of speaker in Udemy.
You can do ofcause all this steps in the single expression now_utc_aware.astimezone[ptz.timezone['Australia/Melbourn']]

__main__ section in video in Udemy lector 
So im going to use f-string in python and im going to say loading and specify the name of var __name__
Okey so what happens if module could be pretty usefull if we call it from command line
print(f'Something')
modules  -  just python files with some code inside.
Typically modules are file system entities.

Package name in the Python is name of folder (directory).
to create a module:
- We must create a directory whose name will be package name.
- Create a file  called __init__.py inside that directory.
    That file __init__.py is what tells Python that the directory is a package as opposited to a standard directory
What happens when a file based packages is imported ?
app/
    pack1/
        __init__.py
        module1.py
        module2.py
import pack1
    that code is loaded and executed and cached in sys.modules with key of pack1

More intresting topic - What are packages in Python language. Packages are a spesialize modules ()

Why packages ?
Mainly is for code organization, easy to use
So basic different between just files grouped in directory and packages, that in packages you have __init__.py file which imported when we import module automatically
and we is able to put any sup-imports in this file. Directory does not support this mechanism, you should import evething from every *.py files in directory.

**We can use __init__.py file to export (expose) just what's needed by our users**
Example:

    `mylib/
        __init__.py  ---------------------->  code in __init__.py ->  | from  mylib.submodule1 import * #(or some functions or classes)              |
        submodule1.py                                                 | from  mylib.mylibsub2.submodule1_1 import * #(or some functions or classes)  |
        submodule2.py
        mylibsub2/
            __init__.py
            submodule1_1.py
            submodule2_2.py
    `

somewhere in the code
`import mylib`

mylib can access everything in mylib.submodule1 and mylib.mylibsub2.submodule1_1 because __init__.py is executed when we import any package (default behaviour).
**Just directories with python's files inside can not support the same behaviour.**

__all__ in __init__.py file  is a list of strings defining what symbols in a module will be exported when from <module> import * is used on the module.

For example, the following code in a foo.py explicitly exports the symbols bar and baz:

__all__ = ['bar', 'baz']

waz = 5
bar = 10
def baz(): return 'baz'
These symbols can then be imported like so:

from foo import *

print(bar)
print(baz)

# The following will trigger an exception, as "waz" is not exported by the module
print(waz)

Example
__init__.py file in flask

from markupsafe import escape
from markupsafe import Markup

from . import json as json # so intresting, import from current directory.

Initialization of class
How to instanciate the class instance ?

class Person:
    language
    def __init__(self, version):
        self._version = version

    @property
    def version(self):
        return self._version


    @version.setter
    def version(self, ver):
        self._version = ver

language is a class attribute /  version is the instance attribute Persone.__init__(created_obj, version_value).

Read-Only properies are created by python when we define only get accessor class.
If class does not have @name_of_property.setter decorator, its read-only property.

Classes scope.
First of all i want to tell that module (file) has its own global scope.
Example 

# module.ps1 file global scope contains Person class and p variable.

class Person:
    language
    def __init__(self, version):
        self._version = version

    @property
    def version(self):
        return self._version


    @version.setter
    def version(self, ver):
        self._version = ver

p = Person(123)

Pilymorphism
The abillity to define the generic type of behavior that will behave differently when apppied to different types

__str__ and __repr__
both of this methods are used to create a string representation of an object.
both of this is return the string.
typically __repr__ is used  by developers - usefull for debugging | called when using repr() function\
__str__ is used then we call str() or print() function
__str__ typically is used to dispalay something to the end user.
print first looks for the __str__ then __repl__ methods.
__eq__ and is operator are bounded together and __eq__  == is

Python is so smart for instance if you impplement __eq__ and does not __hash__ that means by deafaut  __hash__ return None
Because __hash__ by default is implemented according to specific system algorighm and 
p1 = new Person(123)
p2 = new Person(123)

got _eq_ the same but _hash_ other is strange 

**if you implement __eq__ you must implement __hash__ but not othervise**

class Person:

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, Person) and self._version == other._version;

    def __init__(self, version):
        self._version = version

    @property
    def version(self):
        return self._version


    @version.setter
    def version(self, ver):
        self._version = ver

super() -> delegating to the parent class
example: super().method()

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, major):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.major = major

super().__init__()

Python lesson in Udemy.
Classes are created somewhere
When python interpreter encounters a class as it compiles (executes) the code `class Persone`
    - A symbol Person in created in namespace
    - That symbol us a reference to the class Person (it is an object) 
    - How does Python create the class ?
Class is the instance of type that means ->  isinstance(Person, type)  === True
We have type class somewhere in the python ecosystem
and instances of type `class type` is classes (example person = type(class_name, class_bases, class_dict))
self - for insance of object
cls - for some type

function decorators accept function as parameter
class decorators accept type of class as parameter to decorate.

Expressions tree are used to create dynamic functons in appilcation and run them in Run-Time.

Expressions tree represent code like code tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression, for example, a method call or binary operations such as x < y
You can compile and run code represented by expression trees. This enables dynamical modification of executable code, the 
To create expression tree by using API, use Expression class in System.Linq.Expression namespace. This class contains static factory methods that create
expression tree nodes of specific type, for example, ParameterExpressin, which represents a variable or parameter, or MethodCallExpression, which represents a method call.
ParameterExpression, MethodCallExpression and other expression-specifc-types are also defined in the System.Linq.Expression namespace. These types derive from abstract type Expression

Angular linker and compiler mode 
Starting with Angular v11.1. it's possible to partially compile a library.
In our library, let's add the follwing option to tscofig.prod.json
The compilerMode option can have two values:
    full which generates a fully compiled code with Ivy (save result as ngcc above)
    partial which generates code in a stable, but intermadiate form suitable to be published to NPM

The resulting ng build --prod in our library gives us the following tiny-lib.js
class TinyLibComponent { }
TinyLibComponent.ecmp = eengDeclareComponent({
    version: "11.1.0",
    type: TinyLibComponent,
    selector: "lib-tiny-lib",
    ngImport: i0
})
As you can see, this is not exactly the same result as ngcc. We have ngDeclareComponent that looks like defineComponnet above, but the
template has not been transformed to Iny instructions.
This intermadiate transformation can be shipped to NPM package manager.

The Python Language Reference
This reference manula describes the syntax and "core semantics" of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be
exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in objects and of the built-it function and modules are describes in The  Pthron Standard Library.
For an informal introduction into language, see The Pythoin Tutorial. For The C and C++ programmers, two additional manuals exist: Extending and Embededding the Python Interpreter describes
the high-level picture of how to write python extensive module, and the Python/C API Reference Manual describes the interfaces available to c/c++ programmers in details.

Bootstrap some parts of documentation.
Containers
Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your contnt within a given device of viewport.
How they work
Containers are the most basic layout elements in Bootsrap framework and are required when using our default grid system.
containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not reqire a nested container.
Bootsrap comes with different containers:
.container === .container-sm the same width calculation see link - **https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/containers/#:~:text=.-,container,-100%25**
.container which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint} which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint.
.container-fluid which is width:100% at all breakpoints.

Grid system.
Use our powerfull mobile-first grid sytem to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, syx default responsive tears, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.
bootsrap grid system uses containers, rows and columns to layout and align content. It's built with **flexboxes**

`Do not mix **Bootstrap Grid System** with **display:grid** which is new technology to layout`

Display property
Quikckly and responsively toggle the display value of components and more with our display utilities.
Includes support for some of the most common values, as well as some extras for controlling display when printing.

Notaions - обозначения
.d-{value} for instance: d-inline, d-flex, d-block, d-none and so on.

margins  m-1, m-2, m-3, m-4, m-5 no more than 5
paddings p-1, p-2, p-3, p-4, p-5 no more than 5
+ some combinations with t,b,x,y,l,r

Width and Height- possible values in percents - w-0 w-25 w-50 w-75 w-100 | h-0 h-25 h-50 h-75 h-100

Try to rewrite angular docs here.
'DI providers'
Dependency providers by configuration providers, you can make services available to the parts of your application that need them.
A dependency provider configures an injector with DI token, which that injector uses to provide the runtime version of a dependecy value.
If you specify the service class as the provider token, the default behavior is for the injector to instanciate that class with `new` operator.
providers: [Logger]
In the following example, the Logger class provides the Logger instance.

The dependency value is the instance, and the class type services as a lookup key. 
In the next example the injector uses the HeroService class type as the token for looking up heroService.
heroService: HeroService 

providers: [Logger] is the short form of providers: [{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }]
In Angular DI system we no need any inharitance between classes of interface implementation to register some to DI system. 
We must only following the same method names and that enough to invoke some bunch of code.
In that example BetterLogger class can not inharite from Logger class but should has the same method names
- BetterLogger should has method1() as well as Logger class.
[{ provide: Logger, useClass: BetterLogger }]
- UseExisting is alias for classes

- Injector object  [{provider: Logger, useValue: SomeRealObject}]
SomeRealObject is not class, is just javascript object with some functions and properties.

export SomeObject = {
    logs: ['some array']
    log: () => { console.log('log function that just follow Logger class log naming strategy')}
}

mult property used as IEnumerable<IInterface> in dotnet DI system i mean that you can create some DI token with name and class behind then
register more than one provider at least 2


export interface IModel {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  calculate: (something: number) => string;
}

export const SOME_MODELS_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<IModel[]>('SomeToken');

    providers: 
    [
        { provide: SOME_MODELS_TOKEN, useClass: Model, multi: true },
        { provide: SOME_MODELS_TOKEN, useClass: Model2, multi: true }]

Model, Model2 are implementations of IModel interface.

then
    in some constructor of some class (angular component)
    get it's as list, for instance - constructor(@Injector(SOME_MODELS_TOKEN) modesl IModel[]) { ... TODO whatever you want. }

NG_VALIDATORS and NG_ASYNC_VAKUDATIRS are the same DI Token as above but buit-in angular ecosystem.

A biography of Kilian Jornet

When you picture (представлять) mountain climbers scaling Mount Everest, what probably comes to mind are teams of climbers with Sherpa guides leading them to the summit (peak of mount), equipped with the oxygen masks, supplies and tents. And in most cases you would be right, as 97 percent climbers use oxygen to ascend to Everest,s summit, at 8,800 
meters above sea level. The thin air at high altitudes makes the most breathless at 3,500 meters and the vast majority of climebers use oxygen mask past 7000 meters.
A typical climbing group will have 8 - 15 people in it, with almost equal numbers of guides, and they will spend weeks to get to the top after reaching base camp.
But ultra-distance and mountain runner Kilan Jornet Burgada ascended the mount in May 2017 alone, without the osygen mask of fixed rope of climbing (фиксированнная веревка для залазанья)
Oh, and he did it in 26 hours.
With food posining.
And then, five days later, he did it again, this time in only 17 hours.
Born in 1987, Kilian has been training for Everest his whole life. And this really does mean his whole life, as the grew up 2000 meters above sea level in the 
Pyrenees in the ski resort of Lles de Cerdanya in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain. While other children his age were learning to walk, Kilian was on skis (лыжи)
